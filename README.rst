Pumphandle
==========
A (very) work in progress collection of tools for computational and mathematical
Epidemiology.

Contents
--------
Utilities:

- "NetDrop": A simple function for downloading data files from web sources


Dependencies
------------
requests


Versions
--------
0.0.1a - Initial PyPi release version.


Version Notes
-------------
0.0.1a - This release is intended primarily to make the developers life slightly easier by packaging a commonly used function for repeated use. It's not a general-purpose release, and unless you really hate writing very short bits of requests code, it's likely not worth your trouble.


Why 'Pumphandle'?

The repository name is a reference to 'John Snow <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow_(physician)>'_ and the Broad Street Pump
